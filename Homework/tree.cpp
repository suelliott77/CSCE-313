// Description of Code:

/* This software navigates through folders in a manner beginning from a designated location (or the current folder when no location is indicated). 
The navigation is carried out by utilizing the print_tree function that consists of; 
The directory is accessed by using the function to open the designated directory. 
Reading Entries Procedure; It goes through each entry, in the directory by using the readdir function. 
Skipping the directory and parent directories is done to prevent loops by ignoring entries "."...". 
Determining Entry Type; It utilizes the lstat function to distinguish between a file and a directory. 

For every item, in the list provided by the user tool outputs a tree shaped layout using characters, like branches (└─ │).
When dealing with directories it adds a /, to the file name. Uses print_tree again to handle subfolders, in a manner. 
The feature maintains a record of the depth to control the levels of indentation for organizing a presentation. 
The main function kicks off this process using the provided path or the current directory when no path is given. */

// How it fulfills the requirements:

/* The software utilizes recursion to explore all directories and their subdirectories as needed. 
When adjusting the depth variable in coding for indentation purposes you can create a hierarchy that resembles the structure displayed by the tree command. 
Unicode characters are employed to mimic the tree layout by representing branches and lines that separate files. 
Identification of Files and Directories; When the program utilizes the lstat function to recognize directories and adds a "/" to them as needed. This ensures categorization. 
The format specifications, for the assignments presentation. */
