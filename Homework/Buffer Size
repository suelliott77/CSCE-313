1. What can we conclude from the plot? 

Copying a small amount of data incurs a high overhead, as the system needs to make many more 
read/write operations. The sys time is too high due to the increased number of system calls.
With larger block sizes, the system needs to perform fewer read/write operations, which leads to
a decrease in sys time. At the same time, the usr time might increase
