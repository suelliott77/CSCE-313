1. What can we conclude from the plot? 

Copying a small amount of data incurs a high overhead, as the system needs to make many more 
read/write operations. The sys time is too high due to the increased number of system calls.
With larger block sizes, the system needs to perform fewer read/write operations, which leads to
a decrease in sys time. At the same time, the usr time might increase. 

By running this program, you should observe that larger buffer sizes lead to better performance, 
as the program reduces the number of system calls (e.g., read and write). You might notice 
diminishing returns after a certain point (likely around 4 KB), beyond which increasing buffer 
size further may not significantly reduce the copy time. This is due to system limitations and 
the I/O characteristics of the underlying hardware and OS.
