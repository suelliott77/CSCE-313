1a. What files do I see in dir1 when running "ls dir1:"
- file1.txt
- file2.txt
- conflict.txt
1b. What files do I see in dir2 when running "ls dir2:"
- file3.txt
- file4.txt
- conflict.txt

Commands Used:
mkdir dir1 dir2
echo "File1 in dir1" > dir1/file1.txt
echo "File2 in dir1" > dir1/file2.txt
echo "File3 in dir2" > dir2/file3.txt
echo "File4 in dir2" > dir2/file4.txt
echo "Conflicting file in dir1" > dir1/conflict.txt
echo "Conflicting file in dir2" > dir2/conflict.txt

2. What do I see in union after running "ls union:"
- file1.txt
- file2.txt
- file3.txt
- file4.txt
- conflict.txt
Since two files have the same name from two separate directories, only one of the two is shown.
UnionFS shows the file (if there are multiple of the same name) from the higher precedence filesystem, for these two
dir1. So, conflict.txt from dir1 is shown inside of union. 

Commands Used:
sudo apt-get install -y unionfs-fuse
mkdir union
unionfs-fuse dir1=RW:dir2=RW union
ls union

3. What do I see after adding newfile.txt to dir1:
- file1.txt
- file2.txt
- file3.txt
- file4.txt
- conflict.txt
- newfile.txt
After the union directory was made, the new file was added to dir1. It was shown in union because 
UnionFS dynamically manages the view based on the underlying directories (dir1 and dir2).

Commands Used:
echo "New file in dir1" > dir1/newfile.txt
ls union 

4. Commands Used:
fusermount -u union: Unmounts the union directory. 
While, rm -rf dir1 dir2 union: Deletes dir1, dir2, and union directories.
